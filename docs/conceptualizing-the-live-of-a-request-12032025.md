# Summary
I was trying to really imagine, prior to building a site, what the tradeoffs were here, what is going on and the ideas of server-first and local first. I found that during the conference there were two very different talks. Some lady (don't know name)
evangelized EVERYTHING on the server. Tanner L. then says hey, client-first. So its pretty interesting, you are pretty much moving light between objects, you are trapping electrons in magentic drives, as a store of data and a data center is a giant computer of decentralized equipment
and everything is run by AWS. This was my learning experience.
