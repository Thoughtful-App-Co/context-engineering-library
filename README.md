# Context Engineering Library

Context engineering library and build book of resuable best practices and pre-built prompts to help you build ai-powered applications.

### How to Use context engineering library
I recommend using a bracket {} syntax or <xml> bracket when encapsulating prompts. For example, I like to build prompts by providing a pre-prompt. Ex: Use {design} when creating {concept}. <design> CONTENT HERE </design> <content> CONTENT HERE</content>. 

## Overview

Context libraries provide structured approaches to improve AI outputs through:
- Defined guidelines for prompt engineering
- RAG data and embeddings optimizations
- structured rules and command patterns
- System-level instructions and formatting conventions

We want to understand:

## Rule Vectors

### Prompt/Context Engineering Rules 
- Instruction clarity standards
- Context provision frameworks
- Output formatting requirements
- Chain-of-thought triggers
- Few-shot learning templates

### Cursor Rules 
- Command completion formats
- Response behavior modifiers
- Tone and style directives
- Error handling preferences
- Memory utilization guidelines

### RAG Optimization
- Embedding construction patterns
- Retrieval strategy rules
- Context window utilization
- Document chunking standards
- Relevance weighting protocols

### System Instructions 
- Agent behavior parameters
- Tool utilization protocols
- Safety guardrail frameworks
- Multi-agent coordination rules
- Response moderation guidelines

### Language Rigidity 
- Strict semantic frameworks
- Domain-specific terminologies
- Context-sensitive language patterns
- Precision vs generalization balances
- Translation and interpretation rules

### UX/UI Integration 
- Command center interaction designs
- Mobile vs desktop optimization
- Visual cue integration with language models
- Error message standardization
- Progressive disclosure frameworks

### Design Paradigms 
- provide templates to inject into any front end ui, app build or workflow (as a context pointer)

### Design Frameworks 
- Command interface heuristics
- Functional push button mechanics
- Conversational UI patterns
- Direct manipulation standards
- Form-based interaction rules
- Modal vs. modeless interaction schemas

## Usage 

Apply these rules by:
1. Including them in system prompts
2. Embedding them in RAG systems
3. Implementing them in frontend interfaces
4. Training models with rule-aware fine-tuning
5. Building middleware that enforces rule compliance

## Contribution 

Add rules by creating a PR with your additions in the appropriate directory:
- Follow the established format
- Include examples of both rule compliance and violations
- Document expected outcomes
- Cross-reference related rules

## Roadmap 

I want to work on getting some mockups and tests, on most powerful models. Fuck OpenAI and Microsoft (respectfully). After 

### 2025 Q1 Focus Areas
